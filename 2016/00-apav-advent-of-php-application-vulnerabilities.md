# Announcing the Advent of PHP Application Vulnerabilities

25 Nov 2016 by Martin Bednorz

As the year is slowly coming to an end and the Christmas decorations are
starting to brighten up the streets, we at RIPS Technologies decided to
give back to the wonderful community. Starting on **December 1st**, we
are going to open one gift of our advent calendar each day until the
24th. Our gifts are technical blog posts about real-world security
vulnerabilities in popular applications.

## Why?

At RIPS Technologies we continually scan open-source projects with our
award-winning static code analysis solution RIPS for further analysis
improvement. As we grew up with open-source
software all around us and used it for many projects, we are now in the
unique position to be able to give back to the open-source community and
provide it with best-in-class security analysis. This way we can help
open-source projects to remmediate overlooked security issues and to
make the web a safer place.

## The APAV

Each day, starting from December 1st, we are going to release one blog
post until the 24th. Typically, our posts are going to cover one
critical security vulnerability in a popular open-source PHP application
that was found using
RIPS.
Each post will provide insights into different aspects of web
application security issues and help developers to better understand the
selected issue. In addition, we demonstrate how invaluable static code
analysis is to find critical security issues in large code bases. All
detected security vulnerabilities were reported responsibly to the
affected vendors beforehand in a timely manner.

If you can not wait until December 1st you can already have a look at
some bugs we found in the past. Our vulnerability database highlights a
list of security vulnerabilities in popular open-source software that
were found using RIPS and references related blog posts and demo reports
of our tool.

**We wish all our readers a nice December season and a safe year 2017!**
